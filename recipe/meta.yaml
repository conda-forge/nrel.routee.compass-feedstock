  summary: The RouteE-Compass energy-aware routing engine.
  description: |
    RouteE Compass is an energy-aware routing engine for the RouteE ecosystem of software tools. 
    It supports dynamic and extensible search objectives that allow customized blends of distance, 
    time, cost, and energy (via RouteE Powertrain) at query-time. The core engine is written in 
    Rust for improved runtimes, parallel query execution, and the ability to load nation-sized 
    road networks into memory.
